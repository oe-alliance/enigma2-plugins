msgid "Question: I found a problem with the AutoTimer, can you fix it?/nAnswer: First try the AutoTimer version in a recent (experimental) Image to see if the problem was fixed. Then read the Help again and the upcoming FAQs to make sure that this is actually a problem and not expected behavior./nIf you still think there is something wrong with the AutoTimer, please visit http://www.dream-multimedia-tv.de/board and post your problem there./n/nQ: The plugin only adds timers when leaving the configuration, not automatically. What can I do?/nA: From the Overview press MENU and enter the 'Setup'. In this screen enable 'Poll automatically' and you should be good to go."

msgid "Question: My AutoTimer for 'News' does not record the 'Late News'./nAnswer: Check 'Search type' and 'Search strictness' for the given AutoTimer./n/nQ: The show I'm trying to record contains umlauts in its title. AutoTimer does not find it./nA: Check the 'EPG encoding' for the given AutoTimer. For german stations 'UTF-8' should be selected./n/nQ: I seem to be unable to record two subsequent events. There is only a single timer created that spans (part of) both events./nA: From the Overview press MENU and enter the 'Setup'. In this screen disable 'Guess existing timer based on begin/end'."

msgid "Question: You keep talking about help being provided for each parameter. I'm unable to read it (in part or in full)./nAnswer: Try using the default skin and if it works ask the creator of your regular skin. If it still does not work your image might not provide the actual default skin so contact the creator of your image."

msgid "The 'Overview'"
msgstr ""

msgid "The AutoTimer overview is the standard entry point to this plugin./n/nIf AutoTimers are configured you can choose them from a list to change them (OK button on your remote) or remove them (YELLOW button on your remote)./nNew Timers can be added by pressing the BLUE button and the control menu can be opened using the MENU button./n/nWhen leaving the plugin using the GREEN button it will search the EPG for matching events ONCE. To configure a regular search interval of the plugin to search for events open the control menu and enter the plugin setup."
msgstr ""

msgid "The control menu hides less frequently used options of the plugin, including the configuration and default settings for new AutoTimers./n/nWhile you can just open the menu and take a look for yourself, let's go through the available options:/n - Help:/n   What you are looking at right now/n - Preview:/n   Simulate EPG search, helps finding errors in your setup./n - Import existing Timer:/n   Create a new AutoTimer based on an existing regular timer./n - Import from EPG:/n   Create an AutoTimer based on an EPG event./n - Setup:/n   Generic configuration of the plugin./n - Edit new timer defaults:/n   Configure default values for new AutoTimers./n - Create a new timer using the wizard/classic editor:/n   Use the non-default editor to create a new AutoTimer."

msgid "This FAQ is supposed to help everyone unwilling to help themselves by reading all the provided help available, and those who did not find a solution to their problems within the provided documentation./n/nTo make these hints a little easier to read, they are split up on multiple pages. You can go to the next page using the BLUE button on your remote control and back using the YELLOW one. Pressing the RED button or EXIT will close the FAQ."
msgstr ""

msgid "This help screen is supposed to give you a quick look at everything the AutoTimer has to offer./nYou can abort it at any time by pressing the RED or EXIT button on your remote control or bring it up at a later point by selecting it from the control menu using the MENU button from the regular entry point of the plugin (more on that later)./n/n/nBut you really should consider to take the few minutes it takes to read these help pages."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is mostly a matter of taste./nThe Wizard provides you with a reduced set of options and presents them in smaller sets at a time. It is mostly aimed at users not very experienced with this plugin or the 'expert' level features of enigma2./n/nYou can check out the 'classic' editor by opening an existing timer from the overview and if you prefer this view over the wizard you can change the default editor in the setup dialog."
msgstr ""

msgid "This screen should be pretty straight-forward. If the option name does not give its meaning away there should be an explanation for each of them when you select them. If there is no visible explanation this is most likely a skin issue and please try if the default skin fixes the issue./n/nA lot of effort has been put in making the parameters as easy to understand as possible, so give reading them a try ;-)."

Surprisingly even after the hints were added ;-)."
